Command Pattern
The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing:

Parameterizing clients with queues, requests, or operations

Logging and undoing actions

Decoupling the invoker (RemoteControl) from the receiver (Light, MusicPlayer, Thermostat)

Each device operation is encapsulated in a command class implementing the ICommand interface.
